<h1>On Xiaomi&#39;s tracking</h1>
<p>
  So recently I&#39;ve been trying to cut down on how much access to my data Google and Facebook have. It&#39;s going quite well, I&#39;ve moved my &#34;cloudy&#34; needs to my home-server, including email, and switched to an iPhone SE. I&#39;m looking forward to eventually switching to a PinePhone.
</p>
<p>
  However, for quite a long time I&#39;ve been using a Xiaomi Mi Band 3. Last night I randomly woke up because of a notiÂ­fication(I forgot to switch on &#34;Do not disturb&#34; on my phone), and when trying to fall asleep again, I thought about how the band was strapped too tightly onto my wrist. Then another thought came to my head: If I am so against being tracked by Google and FB, why the hell am I sending Xiaomi my heart rate, approximate location, the entire SLEEP SCHEDULE (they know when I&#39;m awake!) and weight!?
</p>
<p>
  And so, I took the band off. I haven&#39;t been using it since. Maybe I&#39;ll get a PineTime some day.
