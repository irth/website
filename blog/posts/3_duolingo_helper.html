<h2>A Duolingo helper to avoid skipping through corrections.</h2>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>
  I tend to go through Duolingo lessons quite fast (if you do not know what
  Duolingo is, I recommend checking it out - it is quite a fun way to learn
  languages, and for free.)
</p>
<div><a href="https://duolingo.com">Duolingo - fun and free way to learn languages</a></div>
<p>
  This results in me usually typing in the sentences at my 80 WPM (well, the
  average is probaly less, but I&#39;m trying to train it to be more consistent), then
  quickly smashing Enter twice to first submit the sentence, and then accept the
  &#34;Correct!&#34; message.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes, however, I make a mistake, and would like to read the correction
  before advancing further. Unfortunately, my monkey brain got trained to mash the
  Enter key twice to go as fast as possible to the next lessons.
</p>
<p>
  Aaand then I decided to fix that with my computer-y powers.
</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<div><a href="./3_duolingo_helper/duolingo-tampermonkey.js">duolingo-tampermonkey.js</a></div>
<p>
  It is a simple userscript for Tampermonkey, which catches all the Enter
  keypresses, and works as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you did the exercise correctly, the second enter gets you to the next one.</li>
  <li>If you made a mistake, the second Enter keypress is ignored, you can read the correction, and then press Enter again to advance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
  To install it you need to get the Tampermonkey extension for your browser from
  the link above, click on its icon, go to &#34;Dashboard&#34;, then &#34;Utilities&#34;, and you
  can paste the URL from below in the &#34;Install from URL&#34; field.
</p>
<p>
  Here&#39;s the link to Tampermonkey and to the script:

  Enjoy!
