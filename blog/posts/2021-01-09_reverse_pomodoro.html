<h1>Reverse pomodoro</h1>
<p>
  Hello 2021.
</p>
<p>
  I am an university student. I don&#39;t think I like being one, and around two weeks before the christmas break my brain decided to literally stop all the productivity. Couldn&#39;t even get myself to check what I am supposed to be doing/learning.
</p>
<p>
  This continued well into the christmas break, and only after the New Year&#39;s I came across a tweet that helped me break out of this productivity sinkhole loop, and I&#39;d like to share it here because I&#39;d be in much more trouble at uni if I didn&#39;t encounter this.
</p>

  &#34;hey so sometimes I don&#39;t feel like doing anything and I like to use an #ADHD hack I call the &#39;reverse pomodoro&#39;. I&#39;m sure I didn&#39;t invent this &amp; many others have thought of it too but if you&#39;re feeling super unmotivated - read this!&#34; - @dustychipura

<p>
  The basic idea, however, is that you do pomodoro, but in reverse - do 5 minutes of work and 25 minutes of fun (or even much more!).
</p>
<p>
  The reasoning is, even 5 minutes is so so so much better than doing literally nothing. And the fun is actually fun, because you don&#39;t have hate yourself for being unproductive because it&#39;s part of the technique.

<p>
  Good luck. YMMV.
